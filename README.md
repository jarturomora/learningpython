My Journey Reading the Book "Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) is an essential super power of data scientists and data engineers, so I decided to look for a book to train people on this programming language in a practical and funny way.

When I decide to teach something, instead of starting writing my own books I would like to see what books are available on the world, and for me [_**Learn Python the Hard Way**_](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is the best book to start learning this programming language from those who has a little or nothing knowledge about programming to those skilled in some other programming language and want to start with python.

This is the kind of book I like since it takes you trough the python learning process by doing a series of practical exercises instead of starting with a lot of technical theory. For those who are unfamiliar with programming, I believe this book will be interesting and challenging, for those that are already savvy with some other programming languages and paradigms like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural, this book could seems to be boring, however I recommend, even for the code ninjas reading this book, to follow each exercise as is, I will result quite interesting (at least this was my case).

In this book [Zed A. Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/) proposes 52 exercises that takes you to the python learning adventure, the author encourage to memorize by practicing the key concepts of python, he recommends to use [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) as study hack, I actually love to that specially since my friend [Alejandro Garcia "El Viejo"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elviejo79) introduced me to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) (You can learn more about Anki, flashcards and [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) in this [TedX talk by El Viejo](https://youtu.be/ipSzg2_lmYE) -En Espa√±ol-). So, if you are going to take this book as a reference to start (o review) with python I recommend you to create flashcards not only for the concepts that the author recommends, but also, to the entire book. You can [download my Anki deck for this book here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1952340901) (it also has some extra concepts I goggled while reading the book or that I learn in [Code School's course "Try Python"](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python/)).

If you want to start to take hands on this book you have the following options:

1. Get the book [from its official website](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), it's just $29.95 USD and you also will have unlimited updates and some extra videos to boost your learning.
2. Get the book on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/).
3. [Read the book on-line for free](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) courtesy from the author.

As you can see, there are no excuses to start with this book today.

### Extra tips
This section will be constantly updated while I'm personally reading the book or when someone who takes one of my training course shares any interesting insight I believe is worth to share here.

- **For Exercise 22:** I recommend to create flashcards using Anki since day one. Invest at least one hour per day reviewing your cards and improving them, also, I suggest to practice some extra exercises to improve you python learning, you can find tons of practicing bits in [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com/).

- **For Exercise 23:** If you are just beginning with Python, I encourage you to follow Zed's recommendation and invest a week reviewing code, or even practicing with some easy examples you realize or from [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com/). It could be boring and even frustrating to see code you don't understand, buy remember that these are your first steps. If you have proficiency in other programming languages, maybe you would decide to dedicate just few hours reviewing code, this is what I did.
