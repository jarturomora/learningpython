Python Project Skeleton Inspired by Zed A. Shawn
------------------------------------------------

### Pre-requirements
Install the following pakages for python according to your operating system's
specific steps, in my experience it takes about 60 minuts in Windows and 5
minutes in Linux. You have to install this packages just once.

1. pip from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
2. distribute from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
3. nose from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose
4. virtualenv from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
